# 2015 Blue Ironhack (Submission One)

*Apologies for the lack of actual code! The project is under progress and will be much more complete for submission two!*

#### Problem:
Moving to a new city can be difficult and stressful. This web app will help people find safe and green places to rent in the West Lafayette/Lafayette area based on their priorities.

#### Description:
The website will prompt the user for some basic information (occupation, work location) and ask them to rank their housing priorities (price, proximity to work location, safety, nearby services, schools, etc). A scoring algorithm will calculate and rank the top apartment options based on the user's priorities and the website will display them via the Google Maps API. The user can adjust their priorities and the website will recalculate accordingly. By finding out what factors matter most, the value is optimized for the user.

#### Data Sources:
- Bootstrap (page layout and design)
- Google Maps API (map visualization, distance calculation)
- Apartment/rental housing data *to be determined*
- Crime data from [CrimeReports](https://www.crimereports.com)
- D3.js (interactive graphs)
*in progress*

#### Installation:
A basic http server is required to run the webpage. *in progress*

#### Keywords:
apartments, rental housing, crime, price, location, West Lafayette/Lafayette
